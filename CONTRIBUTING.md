# Contribution guidelines

First of all, thanks for thinking of contributing to this project. 

Before sending a Pull Request, please make sure that you've been assigned the task on a GitHub issue.

- If a relevant issue already exists, discuss on the issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.
- If no relevant issue exists, open a new issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.

Please proceed with a Pull Request only after you're assigned. It'd be sad if your Pull Request (and your hardwork) isn't accepted just because it isn't ideologically compatible.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Your pull request should:

- Be a IPython notebook. No PRs with `.py` would be merged. The notebook should be named after the algorithm. For example, a notebook for LSTM should be named `LSTM.ipynb`.
- Contain name of the algorithm you implement in its title
- Not be code copied from some other repo or StackOverflow

If you are submitting a notebook already submitted but using a different framework, mention it in your PR title and your notebook's name
