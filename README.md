### Inspiration

[(Back to top)](#list-of-contents)

While learning deep learning, I never could just skim off one source. There were blogs, tutorial websites, books and a lot of stuff. A lot of time was wasted looking at good resources. Thus nervy-notebooks was formed: to create a guide for deep learning to be used by all!
